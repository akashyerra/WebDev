// array

/* 
** In JavaScript, arrays aren't primitives but are instead Array objects with the following core characteristics:

** JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types. (When those characteristics are undesirable, use typed arrays instead.)
** JavaScript arrays are not associative arrays and so, array elements cannot be accessed using arbitrary strings as indexes, but must be accessed using nonnegative integers (or their respective string form) as indexes.
** JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on â€” and the last element is at the value of the array's length property minus 1.
** JavaScript array-copy operations create shallow copies. (All standard built-in copy operations with any JavaScript objects create shallow copies, rather than deep copies).

// slice & splice
// Generally in interviews when they ask for the difference between the slice and splice, majority of the people say that one excludes max in range and the other includes the max in range respectively

console.log("A ", myArr);

const myn1 = myArr.slice(1, 3);

console.log(myn1);
console.log("B ", myArr);

const myn2 = myArr.splice(1, 3);
console.log("C ", myArr);
console.log(myn2);
// But the actual difference is that in slice it gives the subArray but when it comes to splice it remmoves that subarray from the array
