<!-- HTML elements are generally divided into two categories: Block-level and Inline elements.
     Inline Elements: Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They are part of the flow within other elements. Inline elements can contain other inline elements, but they generally should not contain block-level elements. 
     Block Elements: No matter what the width is, block elements will always start on a new line and take up the full available width of their container by default. This means they essentially claim all the horizontal space for themselves, pushing any content that comes after them to a new line. But the inline elements will fit snugly within the flow of other elements, taking up only as much width as their content requires. 
     
     These are the display elements that can be customized/changed using css -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Inline and Block elements</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hey I am the paragraph</p>
    <!-- Block element -->
    <a href="www.google.com">Google</a>
    <!-- Inline element -->
    <div>I am a block element</div>
